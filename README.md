# Minigame-Code
Here's the code of the minigame I developed in my latest YouTube video.
I'm learning how to program stuff and I ended up developing this as a result.
This minigame is inspired by how you create a password in HTML. I just tweaked the names. e.g. checkPassword() -> lotto(), password (variable) -> lotto etc.
I'm interested in coding and all that stuff like 2 square 8 = 32, 4! = 24, 8! = 40320 (good luck solving that!).
